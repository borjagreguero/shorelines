% GET_WAVE_FIELDS
% routine to generate a series of wave fields for given wave
% height, wave directions and wave periods. The conditions are given  
% in jonswaptable.txt. Results computed by XBeach are stored in 
% xboutput.nc and read into the matrices xg,yg for the grid and
% Hg_all and phiwg_all; these represent a transformation matrix
% from which the wave field for an arbitrary wave condition can be
% interpolated.

%% For now assume that the wave model has run and produced nHs by nphi 
%% wave conditions
